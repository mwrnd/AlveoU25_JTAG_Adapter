# AlveoU25_JTAG_Adapter

Alveo U25 Debug Connector to Xilinx JTAG Adapter. The pinout is not available publicly so the signals had to be traced out.

For JTAG, only two components are required: [MEC8-113-02-L-D-RA1](https://www.trustedparts.com/en/search/MEC8-113-02-L-D-RA1) and [SBH21-NBPN-D07-ST-BK](https://www.trustedparts.com/en/search/SBH21-NBPN-D07-ST-BK).

Current State of Project:
